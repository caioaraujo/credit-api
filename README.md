In your local PostgreSQL, create a new dabase called `credit`. 
Then, apply the schema by running in the project root:

`python manage.py migrate`

## Running
In the project root run:

`python manage.py runserver`

Once server started, you may access the local server address (check the output of previous command) to check the API documentation

## Tests
